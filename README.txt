------- READ ME:---TENSEGRITY STRUCTURE MODELS--------------------------------------------
There are 4 folders in the project:

1. Form Finding 
2. Kinematic Model
3. Euler Lagrange
4. Simscape Model

------------SIMULINK MODELS---------------------------------------------------------------
In the first three folders the user can activate the simulation by running the "....._Activation.m" file. Withinthis file the user is able to change a variation of constants, which will influence the behaviour shown in the simulation

When the simulation is done running, the corresponding "....._Animation_plotting.m" file can be activated in order to show the animation associated with the performed simulation. This animation is a series of Matlab plotting windows, and thus cannot be paused or reversed.


-----------SIMSCAPE MODEL-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Simscape model is activated by pressing the play button within the Simscape environment. An animation window within Matlab is automatically activated in which the progress of the simulation can be followed and the animation can be played back.
